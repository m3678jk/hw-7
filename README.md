You are making a graphics editor.

Consider class hierarchy. There must be at least:

the base class for the Shape shape. This class must have a method to display the name of the shape.
descendant classes - Circle, Quad, etc. - at least 5 options;
there should be a class that takes a shape and outputs its name. The class must work with the Shape base class.
Pay attention to the use of interfaces, abstract classes, access modifiers.

There is no single correct way to solve this problem. Try to design a flexible architecture by asking yourself questions like "What happens if this class needs to be changed? What else will change if it needs to be extended here?".
